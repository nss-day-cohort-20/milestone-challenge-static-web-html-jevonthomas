		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Former Amazon Fulfillment Center Area Manager in Columbia, SC and an Army veteran with 5 years of active duty service as a Chemical Officer, with continued service in the Army Reserve as a Public Affairs Officer. A West Point graduate with a Bachelors Degree in Management and received an MBA from Western Governors University.</p>

		<p>I did not enjoy the direction that my career path was headed, so I made the decision to enroll in Nashville Software School to make a career switch to Web Development and could not be happier about that decision.</p>

		<h2>Useful Links</h2>
		<p>These are the resources I used to become a Web Developer</p>
		<div id="list_useful_links">

				<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ULX5FT2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T2_y1vozbP5THQRD" target="_blank"><img src="images/html_css.jpg" alt="a smarter way to learn html and css"></a>
				<p>I ordered the above book from Amazon to learn HTML and CSS. This book was very effective in helping me to learn syntax. I used the Kindle version on my laptop and it made accessing the exercises easier by being able to directly click on the links in the book.</p>

				<p>I ordered the above book from Amazon to learn Javascript. This book was very effective in helping me to learn syntax as well. I too, used the Kindle version on my laptop to make accessing the exercises easier by being able to directly click on the links in the book.</p>

			<div class="each_useful_link">
				<a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development" target="_blank"><img src="images/team_treehouse.png" alt="team treehouse"></a>
				<p>I enrolled in Team Treehouse's Front End Web Development track, and used that to build on the foundations set by the two previously mentioned books. These courses reinforced what I had previously learned, while introducing me to newer concepts that I would dive deeper into in the future, such as Bootstrap and JQuery.</p>

			<div class="each_useful_link">
				<a href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/nss.png" alt="nashville software school"></a>
				<p>With a solid foundation set in Front End Web Development skills, I went on to Nashville Software School's Full Stack Developer Boot Camp in order to learn to design single page web applications. One truly useful aspect to this boot camp is its focus on training us in the ways that we will work once we graduate. We often worked in teams, utilizing Git as a source control method, and performed code reviews. These are skills that many self-taught developers enter the workforce lacking.</p>
